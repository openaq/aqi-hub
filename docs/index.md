## Overview

An Air Quality Index (AQI), also known as an Air Pollution Index (API) or Pollution Standard Index (PSI), is an indicator used to inform the public about air quality. An AQI is a unitless value, often accompanied by a color and categorical label, summarizing the concentration of a single pollutant or multiple pollutants on a standardized scale. It is a primary air quality policy tool shaped by public health considerations, atmospheric chemistry, and political factors. Consequently, different countries have developed their own AQIs to reflect their specific air quality standards and health guidelines. These indexes help communities understand the potential health impacts of current air quality and take necessary precautions. By translating complex pollutant concentration data into a simple, understandable format, AQIs can empower individuals to make informed decisions about outdoor activities and health protection measures.

## What is the AQI Hub?

The AQI is an important tool in communicating air quality to the public, but does not tell the whole story of air pollution. We developed the AQI Hub to present all national and regional AQIs in one place, making them easier to find and compare.

AQIs can vary greatly between countries. The chart below shows how different AQI for a 24 hour average concentration for PM<sub>2.5</sub> can vary between different national AQIs:

```js

const breakpoints = await FileAttachment('./data/breakpoints.csv').csv({typed: true});
const countriesMap = await FileAttachment('./data/countries.json').json();
```


```js

let pm2524hr = breakpoints.filter(o => o.pollutant == 'PM2.5' && o.averaging_period == '24');
pm2524hr = pm2524hr.map(o => { o.concentration_upper ? o.concentration_upper : o.concentration_upper = 500; return o})
pm2524hr = pm2524hr.map(o => { o.country = countriesMap[o.ISO]; return o})

```

```js
Plot.plot({
  marginLeft: 150,
  width: width,
  height: 400,
  x: {domain: [0,500], label: 'PM2.5 24 hr. avg. Âµg/m3'},
  y: {
    label: "National AQI",
    padding: 0
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.barX(pm2524hr, {y: "country", x1: "concentration_lower", x2: "concentration_upper", fill: "hex"}),
  ]
})
```
