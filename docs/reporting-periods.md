## Overview

Many countries report AQIs on varying temporal scales, the most common being daily, hourly, and NowCast values. Each of these AQI values help individuals and communities understand air quality conditions and enable them to make informed decisions to protect their health and well-being. The period of data used to determine the different temporal scale depends on the specific methodology and can vary greatly between contexts.

## Daily

The daily AQI represents the average of air quality over a 24-hour period, typically from midnight to midnight or the time 01:00 to 24:00. This value is associated with the report on how the air quality was the previous day [^1]. Daily AQIs smooth out short term fluctuations and provide a more general overview of air quality. It is used to assess overall air quality trends and provide health advisories for the day.

## Hourly

The hourly AQI gives a more up-to-date overview of air quality conditions compared to the daily AQI. This value is associated with the report on how the air quality was in the previous hour, and is updated hourly. Hourly AQIs can more accurately reflect the air quality during pollution spikes, such as at high-traffic surges or changes in weather patterns. It is particularly useful for monitoring short-term variations in air quality, allowing people to respond more quickly to changes that can impact their health.

## NowCast

The NowCast AQI is a specific type of hourly AQI updated every hour based on the most current data, offering a dynamic, near real-time snapshot of air quality [^1]. Its calculation method places more emphasis on the most recent hours pollutant concentration levels to account for more recent changes. It uses longer averaging periods during stable air quality and shorter averages when the air quality is rapidly changing to account for air quality emergencies such as wildfires [^1]. The NowCast AQI offers a useful middle ground for air quality reporting, blending a more responsive model such as the hourly AQI while still attempting to maintain the stability of the daily AQI.
