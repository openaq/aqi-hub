## Overview

Many countries report AQIs on varying temporal scales, the most common being daily, hourly, and NowCast values.  The temporal period chosen can vary greatly depending on the country’s methodology, which, as noted in the introduction, reflects their own specific air quality standards and health guidelines.

## Daily

The daily AQI represents the average of air quality over a 24-hour period, typically from midnight to midnight or the time 01:00 to 24:00. This value is associated with the report on how the air quality was the previous day [^1]. Daily AQIs smooth out short-term fluctuations and provide a generalized overview of air quality. They are used to assess overall air quality trends and provide health advisories for the day.

## Hourly

The hourly AQI gives a more up-to-date overview of air quality conditions compared to the daily AQI. This value is associated with the report on how the air quality was in the previous hour and is updated hourly. Hourly AQIs can more accurately reflect the air quality during pollution spikes, such as during high-traffic surges or when weather patterns shift. Hourly AQIs are particularly useful for monitoring short-term variations in air quality, allowing people to respond more quickly to spikes in pollution that can impact their health.

## NowCast

The NowCast AQI is a specific type of hourly AQI updated every hour based on the most current data, offering a dynamic, near real-time snapshot of air quality [^1]. Its calculation method places more emphasis on the most recent hour’s pollutant concentration levels to account for more recent changes. It uses longer averaging periods during stable air quality and shorter averages when the air quality is rapidly changing to account for air quality emergencies such as wildfires [^1]. The NowCast AQI offers a useful middle ground for air quality reporting, blending the responsive qualities of an hourly AQI with the stable features of a daily AQI.
