## Markdown

### Citations for References

References are based off of MLA 8th edition formatting with adjustments to better suit our documentation. These adjustments stemmed from the fact that all of our references were found online, a majority from government websites and digital PDFs. 

This platform uses Markdown it footnotes. All citations used within the text should be indicated using brackets and a carrot, as such: [^X]. In the Reference section, ensure that the citation uses the following format:

[^X]: Author. "Title." Publisher, Publication Date, Location, url. 

No space should be used between the closing bracket and the colon. 

In cases such as government websites and digital PDFs, the government department or organization name was used in place of the Publisher. In cases such as webpages, the date last modified was used in place of the publication date. All dates should be in the form Day Month Year using standard abbreviations for the months:
Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., May, June, July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.

The http:// should be omitted before all links. The Reference section is ordered alphabetically, with foreign languages and numbers at the bottom. 

The titles and publishers in their native language should be listed rather than manually translating it to English. 

Example 1: Specific author is listed on a digital PDF. 
Duarte, Filiberto Perez. “Normas Oficiales Mexicanas (NOM) - Salud Ambiental.” 18 Aug.1994, Mexico City, sinaica.inecc.gob.mx/pags/noms.php. 

Example 2: Government website where no author or date modified is listed. 
“Air Quality Index.” Finnish Meteorological Institute, en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/air-quality-index. 

### Citations for Notes

Note sections are added under all breakpoint concentration tables and color scales. These sections include a reference to the source where the information was adapted from. 

The general Note citation format is:
_Note_: Adapted from "Title" (Publication Date), url. Access Date.

The "Note:" text is italicized and followed by "Adapted from."

Similarly to the Reference citation, the date last modified is used for relevant webpages. All dates should follow the form Day Month Year and use the standard abbreviations for the month, as listed above. If there is no date listed, then it is labeled n.d., standing for 'no date.'

Unlike the Reference citation, there is only a period used after the url and access date. The publication date or date last modified is also in paranthesis. A superscripted bracket should be included after the url link so that it is connected to the Reference citations. 

The titles in their native language should be used rather than manually translating it to English. 

Example:
_Note_: Adapted from "PENGIRAAN INDEKS PENCEMAR UDARA(IPU). AIR POLLUTANT INDEX (API)CALCULATION" (n.d.), [https://apims.doe.gov.my/pdf/API_Calculation.pdf](https://apims.doe.gov.my/pdf/API_Calculation.pdf) [^1]. Accessed 27 July 2024.
