## Background

In Ireland, air quality monitoring and assessment are managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) following European Union regulations. 
The EU’s Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) Directives, particularly Directive 2008/50/EC and Directive 2004/107/EC, establish the legal framework for 
air quality standards across member states, including Ireland. These directives are informed by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Air Quality 
Guidelines, which reflect the latest scientific understanding of the health impacts of air pollution. While some pollutant thresholds, such as 
those for nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO), align closely with WHO guidelines, others, like sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and 
particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), are more stringent under WHO recommendations. 

To communicate air quality information to the public in an accessible way, the EPA developed the Air Quality Index for Health (AQIH). Rather than 
applying the European public index, the AQIH was designed specifically for Ireland to translate pollution into an accessible format. As Ireland 
aims to transition toward meeting more stringent WHO guidelines, the AQIH plays a central role in the government’s broader efforts to raise 
awareness and inform the Clean Air Strategy. This index is a numeric scale from 1 to 10 that reflects the current air quality at monitoring stations 
throughout Ireland.  


## Color scale

The AQIH in Ireland uses a 10-point index divided into four color-coded sections: Good, Fair, Poor, and Very Poor. Each category reflects 
increasing levels of air pollution and associated health risks.

## Methods

The AQIH is based on five key air pollutants: Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Nitrogen Dioxide gas (NO<sub>2</sub>), Sulphur Dioxide gas (SO<sub>2</sub>), PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles, PM<sub>10</sub> particles.

All pollutant concentrations are measured in micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m<sup>3</sup>). However, not all monitoring stations measure every pollutant. 
PM1.5 is the most widely monitored pollutant due to its strong link to adverse health effects, while NO<sub>2</sub> is primarily tracked in urban areas 
with heavy traffic.

It is not explicitly stated whether there is a minimum number of 
pollutants required at a station to calculate an AQIH value.

Each station computes a separate index value (ranging from 1 to 10) for each pollutant it monitors. These index values are determined by 
matching the pollutant’s concentration to pre-defined threshold bands, as shown in the EPA’s AQIH breakpoints scale (see table). 

There is no mathematical formula used to convert concentration into index value; instead, the method relies on a direct lookup of the 
measured concentration against the corresponding range in the AQIH table.

The final AQIH value for a given station is the highest individual index value among the pollutants measured at that location. This conservative 
approach ensures that the reported AQIH reflects the greatest potential health risk posed by any single pollutant at that time.
