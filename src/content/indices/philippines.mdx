## Background

In the Philippines, air quality monitoring and assessment are governed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) through 
its Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). The foundational legal framework is the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 (Republic Act No. 8749), 
which establishes national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and mandates the continuous improvement of air quality nationwide.

To inform the public about air pollution in a clear and actionable way, the EMB developed a six-tier Air Quality Index (AQI) system. This 
framework provides color-coded health advisories based on measured concentrations of key air pollutants. Unlike some international systems 
that use numerical scoring such as the EU, the Philippine AQI uses qualitative categories: Good, Fair, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, Very 
Unhealthy, Acutely Unhealthy, and Emergency.  

## Color scale

The AQI in the Philippines uses a 6-point index: Good, Fair, Unhealthy for sensitive groups, Very Unhealthy, Acutely Unhealthy, Emergency. 
Each category reflects increasing levels of air pollution and associated health risks.

Sources do not specify where values between 90.1 and 90.9 
fall. The “Emergency” category is defined as values “Above 
91,” leaving a gap in interpretation for AQI values in the 
90-91 range.

## Methods

The Philippines AQI is designed to communicate the potential health impacts of air pollution by categorizing pollutant concentrations into 
qualitative descriptors (e.g., “Good”, “Fair”, “Unhealthy”) across a standardized scale. The methodology for calculating AQI levels in the 
Philippines is pollutant-specific and incorporates both manual sampling protocols and percentile-based guidelines. 

Air quality data are collected for key pollutants: Total Suspended Particulates (TSP), Particulate Matter (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>), Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), 
Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)

Pollutant concentrations are typically measured in micrograms per normal cubic meter (µg/Nm<sup>3</sup>) or parts per million (ppm). The use of normal 
cubic meter (Nm<sup>3</sup>) assumes standard temperature and pressure conditions. 

For post pollutants, the 24-hour average concentration is used, except for: 
 - O<sub>3</sub> and CO, which also include 8-hour and 1-hour averages, and 
 - NO<sub>2</sub>, which is measured as a 1-hour average for extreme pollution episodes

Sampling is conducted once every six days using manual methods for TSP and PM. A minimum of 12 sampling days per quarter (or 48 days per year) 
is required. Continuous analyzers are not yet widely available, but may enable daily sampling in the future. 

 - Short-term Exposure Limits: 98th percentile values are used to evaluate whether short-term thresholds are exceeded, meaning the pollutant 
 concentration should not exceed the stated level more than 2% of the days in a year (i.e., about 7 days/year)

 - Annual Averages: For PM and TSP, annual values are expressed using the geometric mean, which accounts for the log-normal distribution of 
 pollutant concentrations. This approach helps smooth out year-to-year variability and extreme values.

<Admonition type="note">

When O<sub>3</sub> 8-hour concentrations exceed 0.374 ppm, the AQI must 
be calculated using 1-hour O<sub>3</sub> values instead, due to higher 
acute health risks.

<Admonition type="note">

NO<sub>2</sub> does not have a standard 1-hour AQI guideline for regular 
reporting but is used to indicate extremely high pollution 
episodes.

These breakpoints define the thresholds for transitioning from one AQI category to the next. The AQI is calculated separately for each pollutant 
using its observed concentration and the corresponding breakpoint table. The highest individual sub-index value among all pollutants is then 
selected to represent the overall AQI at a given location and time. This “maximum operator” method ensures that the most health-relevant pollutant 
determines the reported air quality level.
