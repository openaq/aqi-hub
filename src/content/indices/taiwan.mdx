Taiwan's Air Quality Index (AQI) accounts for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, O<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>. Taiwan reports a daily AQI along with a real-time AQI.

The Taiwan Ministry of Environment (MOENV) is responsible for air quality management and establishing and implementing AQIs. It also provides a map of AQI values across Taiwan.

The newest AQI documentation was implemented in December 2016[^1].

## Color scale

Taiwan's Air Quality Index is comprised of six categories:

<ColorScaleImg countryCode="tw" />

<div class="note">
  The Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network includes two categories within
  'Hazardous': 301-400 and 401-500. Each category has distinct breakpoints
  provided.

## Methods

The following is the pollutant breakpoint concentration values provided by MOENV:

```js
breakpointsTable(data);
```

The source material does not document specific sub-index calculation equations. However, through back-calculation of provided pollutant values on the MOENV Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network, it appears to follow the standard sub-index piecewise linear function:

```js
import { piecewiseLatexDoc } from "../components/piecewise.js";
```

```js
piecewiseLatexDoc("AQI");
```

### Daily AQI

The reported daily AQI is the maximum sub-index value calculated for each pollutant of the day. The concentrations of each pollutant in a day are averaged over the specific period to determine sub-index values. The equation used for calculating sub-indices is not provided in Taiwan's documentation.

In general, an 8-hour averaging period for O<sub>3</sub> is used to report the AQI. However, there are a few areas in which using a 1-hour averaging period for O<sub>3</sub> is deemed beneficial for further precaution. In these areas, a sub-index value may be calculated using a 1-hour averaging period in addition to the value calculated using the standard 8-hour averaging period. The maximum sub-index value is reported.

A 1-hour averaging period for O<sub>3</sub> is used when AQI values are calculated to be 301 or higher, as opposed to using an 8-hour period. A 24-hour averaging period for SO<sub>2</sub> is used to calculate AQI values of 200 or greater, as opposed to a 1-hour period.

### Real-time AQI

MOENV also reports real-time AQI values to issue early warnings to the public and offers data for hourly monitoring [^1]. The real-time concentration for each pollutant is calculated based on varying equations and compared to the breakpoint concentration table to determine the sub-index. The maximum sub-index is equal to the real-time AQI value and leading pollutant.

For O<sub>3</sub> using an 8-hour averaging period, the real-time concentration is equal to the value of the last 8-hour moving average rounded to the nearest integer. For example, for an 8-hour average concentration published at 09:00, data from 01:00 to 08:00 was averaged [^1].

For O<sub>3</sub> using a 1-hour averaging period, the real-time concentration is equal to the monitoring data at the time of reporting. A rounding convention is not specified.

For PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>, the real-time concentrations are calculated using the following equation:

0.5 _average of the first 12 hours + 0.5_ average of the first 4 hours.

$$
C_{12} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{12} C_{n}}{12}
$$

$$
C_{4} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{4} C_{n}}{4}
$$

$$
SI = 0.5 \times C_{12} + 0.5 \times C_{4}
$$

6 out of the first 12-hour data entries and 2 out of the first 4-hour data entries are required for this equation to be valid. The moving average of PM<sub>2.5</sub> is rounded to one decimal place, while the moving average of PM<sub>10</sub> is rounded to the nearest integer. The rounding convention for the real-time concentration is not specified for either pollutant.

For CO, the real-time concentration is calculated using a moving average of the last 8 hours. A rounding convention is not specified.

For SO<sub>2</sub> using a 24-hour averaging period, the real-time concentration is equal to the average concentration values in the last 24 hours. For example, for a 24-hour average concentration published at 09:00, data from 09:00 yesterday to 08:00 today is averaged. A rounding convention is not specified.

For SO<sub>2</sub> using a 1-hour averaging period, the real-time concentration is equal to the monitoring data at the time of reporting. A rounding convention is not specified.

For NO<sub>2</sub>, the real-time concentration is equal to the monitoring data at the time of reporting. A rounding convention is not specified.
