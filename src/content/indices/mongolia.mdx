## Background

In Mongolia, air quality assessment and public communication are governed by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism under the authority 
of the “Air Law”, particularly Articles 7.1.2 and 12.3. To operationalize this law, the ministry approved the “Procedure for Evaluating 
and Reporting Air Quality by Air Quality Index”, which formally defines the country’s Air Quality Index (АЧИ) system[^1]. 

The АЧИ is designed in accordance with the national air quality standard MNS 4585:2016, which specifies the technical requirements for ambient 
air quality. Mongolia’s АЧИ system classifies air quality into six categories, each associated with a color code[^2]. These categories range from 
"Pure" to "Very polluted," reflecting increasing levels of air pollution and corresponding health impacts. 


## Color scale

The АЧИ in Mongolia utilizes a 6-point index to convey air pollution levels and their corresponding health impacts: Цэвэр (Pure), Хэвийн (Normal), 
Бага зэргийн бохирдолтой (Slight contamination), Бохирдолтой (Contaminated), Их бохирдолтой (Very polluted), Маш их бохирдолтой (Very dirty). Each category is assigned 
a color and numerical range: 

<ColorScale index="mongolia" value={true} />

## Methods

The АЧИ calculation is pollutant-specific and requires data from at least three major pollutants to compute a valid index. These include: 
Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), Particulate Matter (PM<sub>10</sub> or PM<sub>2.5</sub>), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). 

Each pollutant has an associated averaging time: 
 - PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> use an average of the last 3 hours
 - SO<sub>2</sub>, measured with 1-hour averages
    - If the 1-hour average of SO<sub>2</sub> exceeds 301 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, the АЧИ calculation must switch to using the 24-hour index
 - NO<sub>2</sub>, measured with 1-hour averages
    - If the 1-hour average of NO<sub>2</sub> exceeds 201 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, the АЧИ is calculated using the 24-hour index instead 
 - CO, an 8-hour moving average
    - If only a 1-hour concentration is available, that may be used as an alternative depending on data availability
 - O<sub>3</sub>, an 8-hour moving average
    - If ozone concentration exceeds 250 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (1-hour average), the index must switch to using the 8-hour average to account for acute health effects. 

Pollutant concentrations are translated into index values based on the defined breakpoint table, which assigns specific АЧИ ranges to corresponding 
concentration intervals. 


<BreakpointsTable index="mongolia" />

For each pollutant, the АЧИ is calculated using a linear piecewise function: 

<div class="latex-container">
    <PiecewiseLatexDoc label="АЧИ" />
</div>

<AqiCalculator
  client:only="solid"
  index="mongolia"
  acronym={frontmatter.indexAcronym}
/>

After individual АЧИ values are computed for each pollutant, the highest АЧИ value among them is selected as the overall АЧИ for that time and 
location. This “maximum operator” approach ensures that the pollutant posing the greatest health risk determines the final reported АЧИ level.
