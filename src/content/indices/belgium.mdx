## Background

The BelAQI (Belgian Air Quality Index) was developed in the context of the European ‘JOAQUIN’ project [^1]. It is an adaptation of 
the Joaquin-index specifically for Belgium. This index is used to assess air quality by translating various ambient air pollutant 
concentrations into a single, easily understandable number. BelAQI is used in apps like BelAIR to alert the public to sudden changes. 
It focuses on health impacts related to short-term exposure to pollutants like PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>. 

Belgium also uses the BelATMO air quality index. Its primary goal is to communicate air quality conditions clearly to the public, summarizing 
data from several pollutants into a single number on a scale from 1 (excellent) to 10 (horrible). This index consists of four pollutants: 
an 8-hour average of Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), an hourly maximum of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), a 24-hour average of Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and a 24-hour average of 
Particulate Matter (PM). 

## Color scale

The Belgian BelAQI and BelATMO system of calculation consists of 10 categories:

<Admonition type="note">
  The air quality index does not define specific numerical ranges 
  for the overall index value. Instead, it categorizes air quality 
  into 10 discrete levels, ranging from Excellent (1) to Horrible 
  (10). Each category corresponds to concentration thresholds for 
  individual pollutants, but the overall index is simply the worst 
  (highest) sub-index among them, without an associated quantitative 
  range for the combined value.

## Methods

The old BelAQI, before November 2022 was based on 2005 WHO air quality guidelines. It used 24-hour averages for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. Mortality risk was calculated on 
Relative Risk (RR) values from WHO’s Health Risks of Air Pollution in Europe (HRAPIE) report [^2]: 


- PM<sub>2.5</sub>: 1.0123 → 1.23% increase in daily mortality per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>
- O<sub>3</sub>: 1.0029 → 0.29%
- NO<sub>2</sub>: 1.0027 → 0.27%

### Old BelAQI

_Note_ Adapted from: https://www.irceline.be/en/air-quality/measurements/belaqi-air-quality-index/information


The WHO released new, stricter guidelines in 2021 for both short- and long-term exposure to air pollution. These changes led Belgium to update the BelAQI to better 
reflect actual health risks, including:

- Lower limits for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>.
- New interim targets for pollutants.
- A shift toward using hourly averages for real-time tracking.    



### New BelAQI

<BreakpointsTable variant="newBelAQI" index="belgium" rangeValue={false}/>

To address the lag in responsiveness of 24-hour averages, the new hourly BelAQI uses hourly concentrations, derived using ratios of daily/hourly peaks (based on 
historical Belgian data):

<div class="latex-container">
$${PM_{2.5}}: \times 1.51$$

$${PM_{10}}: \times 1.38$$

$${NO_{2}}: \times 1.51$$

$${O_{3}}: \times 1.10$$
</div>

**New BelAQI Hourly Index Table:** 

<BreakpointsTable variant="newBelAQIHour" index="belgium" rangeValue={false}/>

Each pollutant’s concentration is mapped to an index value between 1 (Excellent) and 10 (Horrible) using pre-defined breakpoint thresholds (which differ for daily vs. hourly values).

The final BelAQI is simply the maximum of the sub-indices. 

<Admonition type="note">
  There is limited publicly available documentation detailing the specific 
  calculation methodology of the BelATMO index, including how concentration 
  thresholds were defined or how exactly it differs from other Belgian or 
  European indices such as BelAQI. Most sources offer only high-level descriptions 
  intended for general public understanding, which makes direct comparison or 
  technical analysis challenging.

### BelATMO

<BreakpointsTable variant="BelAtmo" index="belgium" rangeValue={false}/>

For each pollutant, a sub-index value is determined by matching the measured concentration to the corresponding range in the table. This is a direct categorical assignment – for example, 
if the 8-hour average ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) level is 68 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, it falls in the 61-80 range, which corresponds to an index value of 4 (Fairly Good) . This process is repeated 
for all four pollutants (O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>).

The final BelATMO index is the maximum of these four sub-indices (i.e., the worst pollutant level).

<div class="latex-container">
$$
{AQI} = {Max}({I}_{PM_{10}},{I}_{SO_{2}},{I}_{NO_{2}},{I}_{O_{3}})
$$
</div>

- Geographic Range: This index is calculated for the country, each of the three Regions, major urban areas, and some districts. 

<Admonition type="note">
  The BelATMO is qualitative and meant for public communication only, providing a 
  simplified view of air quality. It does not involve any interpolation or averaging 
  across pollutants. This index should not be used for scientific studies or regulatory 
  decisions — for those, raw pollutant concentration data must be used.
