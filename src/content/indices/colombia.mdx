## Background

In Colombia, the Índice de Calidad del Aire (ICA) is the national standard for assessing and communicating air pollution levels. This dimensionless index ranges from 0 to 500, 
with higher values indicating more severe pollution and greater health risks. Regulated by Resolution 2254 of 2017, the ICA considers six key pollutants, each with defined 
thresholds to categorize air quality and inform the public. 

Bogotá, the capital city, uses a localized version of this system known as IBOCA (Índice Bogotano de Calidad del Aire). While based on the same general principles as the national 
ICA, the IBOCA adapts the calculation method and category thresholds to better reflect Bogotá’s unique environmental and health context.


## Color scale

Colombia’s national ICA calculation consists of six categories:

## Methods

For each pollutant, a set of breakpoints defines the thresholds that divide pollution levels into six distinct categories. Measured pollutant concentrations are evaluated against 
these thresholds to determine their corresponding category. Using these values, each concentration is converted into a numerical index that reflects its relative position within a 
range. This index quantifies the impact on air quality, with lower values signifying cleaner air.

Typically, regions with ozone monitoring stations are required to report the 8-hour ozone AQI. However, in certain regions, using the 1-hour ozone AQI provides a more protective 
assessment. In such cases, both the 8-hour and 1-hour ozone AQI values should be calculated, and the higher of the two should be reported. Additionally, if ozone concentrations 
exceed 394 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, the 8-hour ozone AQI is no longer applicable, and only the 1-hour ozone AQI should be used for reporting. 

Each pollutant has its own sub-AQI value calculated based on its breakpoint concentration. The following piecewise linear function is used:

After calculating the sub-AQI values for each pollutant, the highest sub-AQI becomes the overall AQI. Not all pollutants are required for this calculation–an ICA can still 
be computed from single pollutant if only one is monitored. There is no minimum number of pollutants needed to determine the ICA value.

## Background

The Bogotá Air Quality and Health Risk Index (IBOCA) is the official tool, created by the Secretaría Distrital de Ambiente (Bogotá District Secretariat of Environment) in 2015, 
used to communicate air pollution levels and their associated health risks in Columbia’s capital. Developed as part of a coordinated public health and environmental strategy, 
IBOCA is designed to inform both institutional responses and individual actions for reducing public exposure and mitigating the health impacts of poor air quality. IBOCA evaluates 
air quality based on six key pollutants: PM<sub>2.5</sub> (fine particulate matter), PM<sub>10</sub> (coarse particulate matter), O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO. Its calculation is based on the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s (US-EPA) most recent 2018 method, which replaced Columbia’s earlier index based on the 2012 version. Specifically, IBOCA uses the NowCast method for particulate 
matter, which was developed by the US-EPA to provide timely warnings and reduce 24-hour exposure. 

In addition, IBOCA integrates health risk estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO). Their Air Quality Guideline includes how excess health risk is calculated by comparing 
pollutant levels to a counterfactual concentration. If concentrations go below this given level, there are no observed health effects. 

IBOCA’s methodology was formally updated in Joint Resolution 868 of 2021 and further revised in Joint Resolution 2840 of 2023. Its implementation helped inform Bogotá’s broader 
2030 Air Plan, including the “Comprehensive Health Risk Management Program for Air Quality”, and has supported declaration of air quality alerts during episodes of pollution. 


## Color scale

The IBOCA consists of five main categories with a subcategory for 'Dangerous' representing the severity of health effects. This subcategory exists because the concentration ranges 
for each IBOCA color do not directly correspond to personal exposure, but rather to equivalent levels of excess health risk (ER). For each color category, including 'Dangerous', 
the lower and upper bounds represent pollutant concentrations that result in the same level of ER.:

## Methods

The IBOCA is calculated using real-time data from the Bogotá Air Quality Monitoring Network (RMCAB), which reports concentrations of criteria pollutants: PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO. 

Dimensionless Value Calculation
The IBOCA is calculated to provide a dimensionless value on a scale from 0 to 500. This is based on predefined concentration intervals for each pollutant. Each pollutant is compared 
against its respective thresholds outlined in the table: 


<BreakpointsTable variant="Bogotá" index="colombia" />

- Each pollutant’s index is based on either a weighted moving average (NowCast) or a simple moving average, calculated over a specific number of hours before the current time, depending on the pollutant
- The NowCast method is used for particulate matter, while the arithmetic mean is used for gaseous pollutants


<Admonition type="note">

Note: In the rare case where the IBOCA value exceeds 500, it retains the same qualitative color coding and risk 
category as the purple level. However, in these cases, only the actual pollutant concentrations (not the index 
value) will be reported. 

</Admonition>

**Calculation of dimensionless values for IBOCA:**
1. **Determine Concentration**: obtain most recent concentration values (in µg/m<sup>3</sup>) for each pollutant from the air quality monitoring data

2. **Apply the Standard Equation**

     For each pollutant, use the following formula: 

        <div class="latex-container">

        <PiecewiseLatexDoc label="ICA" />

        </div>

3. **Selection of Worst Conditions**: For each station in the monitoring network, the worst IBOCA condition among the pollutants is selected for communication. 


The equation for calculating Bogotá’s AQI (IBOCA) is a piecewise linear function, which is a standard similar to the U.S. EPA AQI (the IBOCA is modeled after this) 

The equation maps a given pollutant concentration to a corresponding AQI value using breakpoints: Clow and Chigh for lower and upper concentration breakpoints containing 
Cp and Ilow and Ihigh for corresponding index values 

So the entire function consists of multiple linear segments for different concentration ranges → piecewise linear 


**NowCast Method**

For PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>, the NowCast value is calculated using the last 12 hour concentration data points. The most recent data points are weighted to provide a real-time 
assessment. To ensure accuracy, at least two of the last three data points must be available; otherwise, the NowCast cannot be calculated. For the remaining gaseous 
pollutants, concentrations are based on moving averages that are calculated over a specific number of hourly data points: for O<sub>3</sub> and CO, no averaging is applied (instead, 
instantaneous values are used), while for NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, the average is taken over one hour of data. 

1. Data Selection: select the last 12 hourly concentration values (in µg/m<sup>3</sup>) of the specific pollutant 

2. Calculate the weighting factor (w) for each of the previous hours based on their recency. This is done using a predefined formula: 
        $$ W = \frac{C_{\text{min}}}{C_{\text{max}}} $$

3. Calculate NowCast Value: 
        $$ \text{NowCast} = \frac{\sum (C_i \times w_i)}{\sum w_i} $$

        Where: 
        Ci = concentration value of the pollutant for hour (i)
        Wi - corresponding weight for hour (i)
