## Background

The Bogotá Air Quality and Health Risk Index (IBOCA) is the official tool, created by the Secretaría Distrital de Ambiente (Bogotá District 
Secretariat of Environment) in 2015, used to communicate air pollution levels and their associated health risks in Columbia’s capital. Developed as 
part of a coordinated public health and environmental strategy, IBOCA is designed to inform both institutional responses and individual actions for 
reducing public exposure and mitigating the health impacts of poor air quality. IBOCA evaluates air quality based on six key pollutants: PM<sub>2.5</sub> 
(fine particulate matter), PM<sub>10</sub> (coarse particulate matter), O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO. Its calculation is based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 
(US-EPA) most recent 2018 method, which replaced Columbia’s earlier index based on the 2012 version. Specifically, IBOCA uses the NowCast method for 
particulate matter, which was developed by the US-EPA to provide timely warnings and reduce 24-hour exposure. 

In addition, IBOCA integrates health risk estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO). Their Air Quality Guideline includes how excess health risk 
is calculated by comparing pollutant levels to a counterfactual concentration. If concentrations go below this given level, there are no observed health effects. 

IBOCA’s methodology was formally updated in Joint Resolution 868 of 2021 and further revised in Joint Resolution 2840 of 2023. Its implementation helped 
inform Bogotá’s broader 2030 Air Plan, including the “Comprehensive Health Risk Management Program for Air Quality”, and has supported declaration of air 
quality alerts during episodes of pollution. 



## Color scale

The IBOCA consists of five main categories with a subcategory for 'Dangerous' representing the severity of health effects:

## Methods

The IBOCA is calculated using real-time data from the Bogotá Air Quality Monitoring Network (RMCAB), which reports concentrations of criteria pollutants: 
PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO. 

Dimensionless Value Calculation
The IBOCA is calculated to provide a dimensionless value on a scale from 0 to 500. This is based on predefined concentration intervals for each pollutant. 
Each pollutant is compared against its respective thresholds outlined in the table: 


<BreakpointsTable index="bogota" />

- Each pollutant’s index is based on either a weighted moving average (NowCast) or a simple moving average, calculated over a specific number 
of hours before the current time, depending on the pollutant

- The NowCast method is used for particulate matter, while the arithmetic mean is used for gaseous pollutants


<Admonition type="note">

In the rare case where the IBOCA value exceeds 500, it retains the same qualitative color coding and risk category as the purple level. 
However, in these cases, only the actual pollutant concentrations (not the index value) will be reported.

**Calculation of dimensionless values for IBOCA**
1. Determine Concentration: obtain most recent concentration values (in µg/m<sup>3</sup>) for each pollutant from the air quality monitoring data

2. Apply Standard Equation - For each pollutant, use the following formula: 

    $$ \text{IBOCA}_p = \left( \frac{I_{\text{high}} - I_{\text{low}}}{C_{\text{high}} - C_{\text{low}}} \right) (C_p - C_{\text{low}}) + I_{\text{low}}  $$
    - C<sub>p</sub> = concentration of the pollutant 
    - C<sub>mayor</sub> = Threshold greater than or equal to C<sub>p</sub> in the concentration ranges of the contaminant p of the Table 1 (for particulate matter, 
    refers to weighted moving average concentrations; for gases, refers to moving average concentrations).

3. Selection of Worst Conditions: For each station in the monitoring network, the worst IBOCA condition among the pollutants is selected for communication. 

<Admonition type="note">

The equation for calculating Bogotá’s AQI (IBOCA) is a piecewise linear function, which is a standard similar to the U.S. EPA AQI (the IBOCA is modeled after this) 
    - The equation maps a given pollutant concentration to a corresponding AQI value using breakpoints: C<sub>low</sub> and C<sub>high</sub> for lower and upper concentration 
    breakpoints containing C<sub>p</sub> and I<sub>low</sub> and I<sub>high</sub> for corresponding index values 
    - The entire function consists of multiple linear segments for different concentration ranges → piecewise linear

**NowCast Method**

For PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>, the NowCast value is calculated using the last 12 hour concentration data points. The most recent data points are weighted to provide a real-time 
assessment. To ensure accuracy, at least two of the last three data points must be available; otherwise, the NowCast cannot be calculated. For the remaining gaseous pollutants, 
concentrations are based on moving averages that are calculated over a specific number of hourly data points: for O<sub>3</sub> and CO, no averaging is applied (instead, instantaneous 
values are used), while for NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, the average is taken over one hour of data. 

1. Data Selection: select the last 12 hourly concentration values (in µg/m<sup>3</sup>) of the specific pollutant
2. Calculate the weighting factor (W) for each of the previous hours based on their recency. This is done using a predefined formula: 
$$ W = \frac{C_{\text{min}}}{C_{\text{max}}} $$

3. Calculate NowCast value: 

    $$ \text{NowCast} = \frac{\sum (C_i \times w_i)}{\sum w_i} $$
    - C<sub>i</sub> = concentration value of the pollutant for the hour (i)
    - W<sub>i</sub> = corresponding weight for hour (i)
