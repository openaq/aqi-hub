## Background

Monaco (Principality of Monaco) assesses and communicates urban air quality through their national Indice Qualité de l'air (IQA), developed in collaboration 
with AtmoSud, the regional air monitoring agency. The AQI ranges from 0 (very good) to 100 (alert threshold) and is based on real-time data collected from 
five monitoring stations across the Principality[^1]. In addition to current conditions, forecasted AQI values for the following day are also provided, integrating 
meteorological predictions. 

Monaco’s IQA methodology is designed to be straightforward, which reflects public exposure to key urban pollutants. It considers three major pollutants: 
nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). 

## Color scale

The IQA uses 10 color-coded index levels that fall under six broader air quality categories. Each color represents a specific range of AQI values and is 
designed to provide a quick visual cue of pollution severity and associated health risks:  Très Bon (Very Good), Bon (Good), Moyen (Average), Mediocre (Poor), 
Seuil d’information (Information Threshold), Seuil d’alerte (Alert Threshold)

## Methods

1. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) - hourly concentrations
2. Particulate Matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) - daily average
3. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) - maximum 8-hour rolling average

For each of these three pollutants, this breakpoints table defines the thresholds that divide pollution levels into the six categories:

Each “Bon” and “Mediocre” range is subdivided further for finer categorization. Sources have not specified reasonings for this division in the categories.

**Sub-indices**
        For each pollutant, a sub-index is calculated by comparing the pollutant’s measured concentration to a defined set of concentration breakpoints. These breakpoints correspond to 
        air quality categories that range from “Très Bon” (very good) to “Seuil d’alerte” (alert threshold). 

**Final IQA Calculation (Maximum Rule)**
        The final index is calculated as the maximum of the sub-indices derived from three pollutants: PM<sub>10</sub> (24-hour average), NO<sub>2</sub> (hourly average), and O<sub>3</sub> (max 8-hour rolling average). 
        All three pollutants are used to ensure a comprehensive measure of air quality. However, if data from one or more pollutants is missing then an overall AQI can’t be computed 
        for that location under the current methodology. The index relies on having sub-indices for each of the three pollutants to select the maximum value. Incomplete data would prevent 
        an official AQI value from being reported for that site. 


        <div class="latex-container">
        $$
        {IQA} = {Max}({I}_{NO_{2}},{I}_{PM_{10}},{I}_{O_{3}})
        $$
        </div>

        This ensures that the worst pollutant determines the air quality rating for the day. 


**Threshold interpretation**
        The index ranges from 0 to over 100, segmented into categories from “Très Bon” (Very good) to “Seuil d’alerte” (Alert Threshold). Each sub-index corresponds to a category 
        depending on the concentration range the pollutant falls into. The categories also have associated color codes to visually communicate the air quality level.
