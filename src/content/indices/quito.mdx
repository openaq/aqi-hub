## Background

The Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito (MDMQ), through its air monitoring network REMMAQ, provides real-time data on ambient 
air quality to both policymakers and the public. This initiative is part of a broader effort to uphold the population’s access to healthy environments, 
especially in high-altitude areas like Quito, where geography and weather patterns intensify air pollution impacts. 

REMMAQ operates remote stations throughout Quito and nearby valleys to track six key pollutants: PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub>. To make this 
information accessible, the Ministry of Environmental Management created Indice Quiteño de la Calidad Del Aire (Quito Air Quality Index or IQCA). 
The IQCA translates pollutant concentration data into a numerical and color-coded scale, allowing for easier interpretation of air pollution.  


## Color scale

The Quito Air Quality Index consists of six categories:

## Methods

First, specific air quality indicators are identified, including the common pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>),
 sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO). For each pollutant, the breakpoint table is used to establish thresholds that 
 categorize the levels of pollution into different categories (desirable, acceptable, caution level...). 

The measurements of pollutant concentrations are collected and compared against these breakpoints. Each concentration is translated into a corresponding 
numerical index value based on its position relative to the breakpoints. The index, often defined on a scale from 0 to 100, represents the degree of 
air quality impact where lower values indicate better air quality.

**Individual Pollutant Calculation**

The following mathematical expressions are used for each pollutant to calculate the IQCA  

(Ci: concentration of the given pollutant)

**Particulate Matter 2.5** (PM<sub>2.5</sub> µg/m<sup>3</sup>) - Averaging Time: 24 hours

| **Concentration** | **Formula** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 0 < Ci ≤ 50 | $$ IQCA = 2.00 \times Ci $$ |
| 50 < Ci ≤ 250 | $$ IQCA = Ci + 50.00 $$ | 
| 250 < Ci | $$ IQCA = Ci + 50.00 $$ | 


**Particulate Matter 10** (PM<sub>10</sub> µg/m<sup>3</sup>) - Averaging Time: 24 hours

| **Concentration** | **Formula** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 0 < Ci ≤ 100 | $$ IQCA = Ci $$ |
| 100 < Ci ≤ 250 | $$ IQCA = 0.6667 \times Ci + 33.333 $$ | 
| 250 < Ci ≤ 400 | $$ IQCA = 0.6667 \times Ci + 33.33 $$ | 
| 400 < Ci | $$ IQCA = Ci - 100 $$ | 


**Ozone** (O<sub>3</sub> µg/m<sup>3</sup>) - Averaging Time: 8 hours

| **Concentration** | **Formula** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 0 < Ci ≤ 100 | $$ IQCA = Ci $$ |
| 100 < Ci ≤ 200 | $$ IQCA = Ci $$ | 
| 200 < Ci ≤ 600 | $$ IQCA = 0.5 \times Ci + 100.00 $$ | 
| 600 < Ci | $$ IQCA = 0.5 \times Ci + 100.00 $$ | 


**Carbon Monoxide** (CO mg/m<sup>3</sup>) -  Averaging Time: 8 hours

| **Concentration** | **Formula** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 0 < Ci ≤ 10 | $$ IQCA = 10 \times Ci $$ |
| 10 < Ci ≤ 15 | $$ IQCA = 20 \times Ci - 100.00 $$ | 
| 15 < Ci ≤ 30 | $$ IQCA = 6.67 \times Ci + 100.00 $$ | 
| 30 < Ci | $$ IQCA = 10 \times Ci $$ | 


**Nitrogen Dioxide** (NO<sub>2</sub> µg/m<sup>3</sup>) - Averaging Time: 1 hour  (max concentration of 1-hour readings)

| **Concentration** | **Formula** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 0 < Ci ≤ 200 | $$ IQCA = 0.5 \times Ci $$ |
| 200 < Ci ≤ 1000 | $$ IQCA = 0.125 \times Ci + 75.00 $$ | 
| 1000 < Ci ≤ 3000 | $$ IQCA = 0.1 \times Ci + 100.00 $$ | 
| 3000 < Ci | $$ IQCA = 0.1 \times Ci + 100.00 $$ | 


**Sulfur Dioxide** (SO<sub>2</sub> µg/m<sup>3</sup>) - Averaging Time: 24 hours

| **Concentration** | **Formula** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 0 < Ci ≤ 62.5 | $$ IQCA = 0.8 \times Ci $$ |
| 62.5 < Ci ≤ 125 | $$ IQCA = 1.333 \times Ci + 66.667 $$ | 
| 125 < Ci ≤ 200 | $$ IQCA = 0.125 \times Ci + 175.00 $$ | 
| 200 < Ci | $$ IQCA = 0.125 \times Ci + 175.00 $$ |  

<Admonition type="note">

There appears to be a contradiction in how the final IQCA is calculated across different sources. Some sources state 
that the IQCA is determined by computing a weighted average of the individual pollutant indices, reflecting the varying toxicity 
and health impacts of each pollutant. However, other sources indicate that the final IQCA value is simply the maximum of the individual 
pollutant indices, highlighting the most severe pollutant at a given time to ensure a more immediate public health warning.
