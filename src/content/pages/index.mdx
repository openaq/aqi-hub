## Overview

An Air Quality Index (AQI), also known as an Air Pollution Index (API) or Pollution Standard Index (PSI), is an indicator used to inform the public about air quality. An AQI is a unitless value, often accompanied by a color and categorical label, summarizing the concentration of a single pollutant or multiple pollutants on a standardized scale. AQIs help communities understand the potential health impacts of current air quality conditions and take necessary precautions. By translating complex pollutant concentration data into a simple, understandable format, AQIs can empower individuals to make informed decisions about how to protect their health, such as curbing outdoor activities.

AQIs are shaped by public health considerations, atmospheric chemistry, and political factors. Consequently, countries and other regulatory bodies develop their own AQIs to reflect their particular air quality standards and health guidelines.
