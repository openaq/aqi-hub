## Overview

In addition to numeric and categorical labels, colors and symbols are often used
in Air Quality Indexes (AQIs) to indicate the level of pollution danger and the
necessary precautionary measures. Clear communication is crucial in enabling
people to understand and respond effectively to changes in air quality, which
has a direct impact on public health. AQIs rely heavily on visual elements, such
as color coding, icons, and symbols, to quickly convey the severity of pollution
levels, making them more accessible across languages and literacy levels in
frequent public health announcements. This review examines how AQIs are
presented and interpreted, with a particular focus on their design, clarity, and
impact on public understanding and behavior. Similar color spectrums are also
found in other public health systems, such as fire danger ratings and heat risk
forecasts, where colors like green, yellow, and red help the public understand
risks and respond appropriately. Consistent use of colors and symbols enhances
risk recognition and facilitates timely protective actions.

## Color

Color plays a vital role in public health communication by attracting attention,
conveying urgency, and enhancing message retention across diverse audiences. The
strategic use of color can enhance comprehension of complex health information
and influence behavior. AQI systems worldwide employ varied color schemes that
reflect both scientific thresholds and cultural interpretations of risk.
Generally, cooler tones, such as green or blue, typically represent healthy air,
while warmer colors, like orange, red, purple, or black, signal increasing
levels of pollution and a higher health risk[^1]. These variations in color
thresholds influence how risk is perceived, underscoring the need for intuitive
AQI design. Color is a powerful tool in public health communication that helps
convey risk levels clearly and influences how people understand and respond to
health information across different cultures.

Utilizing colorblind-safe palettes, such as those developed by Color Universal
Design (CUD) or the 2024 updated U.S. EPA, which have been tested explicitly for
colorblind visibility[^2]. However, many systems can present accessibility
issues due to cultural specificity, color vision deficiencies, and complex
language. This calls for a multimodal approach that combines accessible colors,
clear icons, simple language, and numeric values to ensure effective communication
across diverse audiences and abilities[^3].

## Symbols and Icons

Symbols and icons are also used in some contexts, in addition to numeric and
color-based systems for AQI. Symbols and icons further enhance AQI comprehension,
especially for populations with limited scientific literacy, by activating
intuitive visual cues that convey risk at a glance. The effectiveness of
symbolic communication depends on cultural context, local familiarity with
imagery, and the audienceâ€™s literacy levels, which highlights the need for
regionally tailored visual systems. Visual symbols, such as masks, communicate
the precautions people can take. Although not common in official AQIs,
anthropomorphic symbols such as smiling or frowning faces appear in some
visualizations to convey emotional cues about air quality. Systems like
South Korea's CAI even add personal protective equipment (PPE), in the form of
face masks, to signal safety or risk. These visuals help make data more relatable, especially for broad audiences, but are
still rarely used in standardized indexes.
